On a recent project, I had the chance to integrate Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) with Adobe Target. More specifically, the goal was to do Experience Targeting (XT) from within AEM’s interface. That means authors in AEM can use the UI they’re accustomed to in order to create offers/experiences for their various user segments/audiences. The end user then sees the experience that Target deems is most relevant based on what it knows about the user and AEM serves the experience.

While this integration has been around since AEM 6.2, there are several gotchas that I discovered during this project. The article documents the pitfalls and best practices that enrich existing Adobe documentation and hopefully, help you get the most out of your Adobe investment.
